This is my Typescript version of the excellent course material from Jeff Delaney @fireship.io
course: https://fireship.io/courses/react-next-firebase/
course repo:https://github.com/fireship-io/next-firebase-course

Built with Yarn
First run YARN INSTALL

then update the firebaseConfig file [next-app/lib/firebase-config.ts] with your own configs.

Then, with your Firebase project configured you should be able to run YARN DEV and enjoy.
